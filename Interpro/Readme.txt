Interpro domain search on arabidopsis thaliana UMAMIT genes yielded IPR000620 and IPR030184. Pfam family domain yielded PF00892.
Looking at all genes with these domains, most genes were UMAMIT except for 3 genes with IPR000620 (and PF00892), and 4 genes with IPR030184. Two of these four genes with IPR030184 were UMAMIT pseudo genes (UMAMIT16-PSI, UMAMIT43-PSI) and other two also had membrane transporter activity indicating they might be novel UAMAITs. Among the three genes with IPR000620, two of them are involved in sugar and nucleotide transport activity and one has EamA transporter activity similar to UMAMITs indicating it might be yet another novel UMAMITs

IPR000620, IPR030184 and PF00892 search on wheat genes resulted in 194,192 and 194 genes respectively. All genes were same for IPR000620 and PF00892 results. 10 genes with IPR030184 were not present in IPR000620 results.
