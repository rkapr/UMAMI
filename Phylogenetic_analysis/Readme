1. Gene by gene: Each gene was aligned to top ten genes in protein blast results using MUSCLE (ebi.co.uk) REST API. The nucleotide sequence was downloaded from ensembl plants biomart (also used for protein blast and getting protein sequences). {More details about why prtein sequence was used for blast and nucleotide sequence for phylogenetic analysis}. The REST API also returned neighborhood joining phylogenetic tree for each gene
